Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes
also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is
denoted by G(V, E).

Graph data structures are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships
between objects or entities. They are particularly useful in fields such as social network analysis,
recommendation systems, and computer networks. In the field of sports data science, graph data
structures can be used to analyze and understand the dynamics of team performance and player
interactions on the field.

**Components of a Graph:**

- Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as
  vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabeled.
- Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes
  in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules.
  Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labelled/unlabelled.
